Mutation is a key feature of any biological system and therefore the evolution of the mutation rate is a subject of many theoretical and experimental studies. 
A major factor complicating any attempt to model the evolution of the mutation rate is recombination. 
Recombination affects the evolution of the mutation rate both at the individual and the population level, and its effect depends on other factors, such as the population size, the strength and consistency of selection, and the population structure.

Here we present a model in which mutaion is induced by stress. We show that this induction can evolve in the presence of rare recombination (such as expirienced by bacteria and yeast) and explore the interplay of beneficial mutations, recombination, and stress-induced mutation during the accumulation of deleterious mutations in small populations in a process known as *Muller's ratchet*.
