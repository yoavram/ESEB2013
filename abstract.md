The rate at which mutations occur plays a key role in many important topics in biology, from the evolution of sex to the emergence of drug resistance in human pathogens. 
Numerous empirical studies show that mutation can be induced by stress and that this induction can be regulated. 
Stress-induced hypermutation has a potential to affect our understanding of many biological processes, from ecology and evolution to epidemiology and oncology. 
However, theoretical treatment of this phenomena is still lacking. 
We developed models that describe the evolution of stress-induced hypermutation, both in asexual and sexual populations, in the face of adaptive evolution and in constant environments. 
Our results show that stress-induced hypermutation is favored by selection, even in the presence of recombination, and that mutator alleles that induce hypermutation only under stress are advantageous over constitutive mutators and non-mutator alleles.
