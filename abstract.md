The mutation rate is a key feature of any biological system, reflecting the rate at which genetic variation is generated every generation. Therefore, the evolution of the mutation rate is a subject of theoretical and experimental studies. 
A major cause of complication in any attempt to model the evolution of the mutation rate is recombination. The effects of recombination on the evolution of the mutation rate are spread across selection levels and are dependent on other factors such as the population size, the strength and consistency of selection, and population structure.
