Mutation is a key feature of any biological system and therefore the evolution of the mutation rate is a subject of many theoretical and experimental studies. 
A major cause of complication in any attempt to model the evolution of the mutation rate is recombination. The effects of recombination on the evolution of the mutation rate are spread across selection levels and are dependent on other factors such as the population size, the strength and consistency of selection, and the population structure.
Here we present a model mutation and recombination in which mutaion is regulated by stress. We show that this regulation can evolve in the presence of rare recombination (such as expirienced by bacteria and yeast) and explore the interplay of beneficial mutations, recombination, and stress-induced mutation during the accumulation of deleterious mutations in small populations in a process known as *Muller's ratchet*.
